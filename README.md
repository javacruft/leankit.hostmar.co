# Leankit URL director-thing

Leankit's cool, and it has this URL card magic. So this allows you to support multiple external bug trackers via `<protocol>:<info>`

## Supported trackers

### Github

Use `gh:<user>/<repo>/<issue>` to link to either a merge request or a Github bug for that repo.

### LaunchPad

Use `lp:<bug-number>` to link to a LaunchPad bug.

### CodeReview

Use `cr:<request>` to link to a CodeReview on http://codereview.appspot.com
